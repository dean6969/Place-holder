Let's say I have two points within the same git hub wiki page, which for this we'll call place 1 and place 2.

##Title

###Place 1

Hello, this is some text to fill in this, [here](place2), is a link to the second place.

###Place 2

Place one has the fun times of linking here, but I can also link back [here](place1).
An alternative is a ToC.

##Title
[ToC]
###Place 1
###Place 2
Is there any way to do this? Note - seen this so I'll assume it's on topic. Also, that deals with going between files, this one deals with going between the same file.
